In the past, I've had the opportunities to work on some challenging and motivating projects. Some of them include writing a cryptography standard library for the Chapel programming language [<a href="">1</a>], working on improving aviation safety at the NASA Ames Research Center with <a href="https://twitter.com/miladmemarzadeh">Milad Memarzadeh</a>, and contributing to research at the intersection of privacy and behavioral economics with <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/">Alessandro Acquisti</a>. I also assisted in the teaching of the course <i>14-811: Applied Adversarial Machine Learning (S21)</i> @ Carnegie Mellon University.
